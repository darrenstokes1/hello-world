              Modern web design began as web browsers developed the ability to display images. During this time, developers
              used clever means to manipulate tables and create a grid type structure from which to work. Javascript came on the scene
              in the mid-nineties and dynamically improved HTML. A few years later, CSS introduced new methods of styling and continues to evolve rapidly.

              Currently, Javascript seems to be the language of choice for both frontend and
              backend web development. I see this trend continuing in the future. React, Angular, and Node coupled with MongoDB will become
              increasingly popular as society progresses into the Internet of Things.
